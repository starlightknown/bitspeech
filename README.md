# 💡 Inspiration

I thought of social media that focuses on communication, community-based input, interaction, content-sharing, and collaboration. Why not make something which is one step ahead of all the apps currently in the market. BitSpeech also focuses on earning! Let's see how

# ⚙ What it does

BitSpeech is an app where you can join and create your own communities and engage with people by making posts called "Bits". If people start engaging then you will receive Diamonds which you can use to buy someone else's NFTs. At BitSpeech you can generate your own NFT too! Yes, if you are the author of the post, you get the option of "Generate NFT".Your post will get transformed into a beautiful NFT and it's ready to mint whenever you want. You can also see your NFT collection by visiting your profile. Other people can see and buy it too! PS PS- It has cats too!

# 🛠 How we built it

This is a flask application. Based on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python

# 💪 Challenges we ran into

I wanted to implement Deso and a bitcoin wallet but I didn't have much knowledge and ended up with less time.

# 📌 Accomplishments that we're proud of

I worked without my teammates this time and after a lot of struggle made a working project

# 📚 What we learned
I learned a lot about web3 and NFTs even tho I could not implement them all.

# ⏭ What's next for BitSpeech

Make UI improvements, and add features to show diamonds earned.
